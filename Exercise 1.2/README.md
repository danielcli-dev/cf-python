## What data structure would you use for recipe_1?

A dictionary for the structure of recipes makes the most sense because they have key-value pairs that clearly show the description of the values. Another useful feature is sorting elements by their keys or their values. In addition, dictionaries are mutable so they can be updated at any time through replacing elements, concatenation, etc. Listsrecip can also be created from dictionaries.

## What data structure would you use for all_recipes?

A list for the outer structure works because it is mutable like a dictionary, but does not need a key. Also, lists are sequential in nature and also require less memory than dictionaries. It also means recipes with the same name can be stored.
